Atom free Text editor keyboard shortcuts

This page lists keyboard shortcuts for the Atom text editor that I find valuable and use a lot. Since I'm using a Atom editor, I have 

mainly listed the keyboard shortcuts for Windows until now. This list is by no means meant to be a complete listing of every available 

shortcut. I will keep update whenver heavily to use a Mac.
