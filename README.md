# Atom Keyboard Shortcuts

Atom is a hacker editor which downloadable url is https://atom.io/ 

This page lists keyboard shortcuts for the Atom text editor that I find valuable and use a lot. Since I'm using a Atom editor, I have mainly listed the keyboard shortcuts for Windows until now. This list is by no means meant to be a complete listing of every available
shortcut. I will keep update frequently as well as a Mac's Keyboard shortcut.

 * Current latest is Version 1.4.3 but I am still miss colums selection most of population text editer have it such as Sublime. :sweat_smile:
 ~~Why am I use Atom Editor? because here is GitHub Playground~~.
