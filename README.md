Atom free Text editor keyboard shortcuts

This page lists keyboard shortcuts for the Atom text editor that I find valuable and use a lot. Feel free to fork the page and add your own favorites. Pull Requests welcome!

This list is by no means meant to be a complete listing of every available shortcut. It simply lists the shortcuts that I use on a regular basis. For a complete listing of all available shortcuts, consult the Settings > Keybindings page in Atom.

Since I'm using a Mac, I have mainly listed the keyboard shortcuts for Mac OS X. Please feel free to add the Windows or Linux shortcuts.

Where the shortcut is provided by a package, I have added a link to the package.
