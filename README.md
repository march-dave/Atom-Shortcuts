# Atom Keyboard Shortcuts

Atom is a hacker editor which url is https://atom.io/


This page lists keyboard shortcuts for the Atom text editor that I find valuable and use a lot. Since I'm using a Atom editor, I have mainly listed the keyboard shortcuts for Windows until now. This list is by no means meant to be a complete listing of every available
shortcut. I will keep update frequently as well as a Mac's Keyboard shortcut.
